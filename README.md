# devPortfolioRevised

This is my developer website profile page.  
Just wanted to create a presentable webpage that promotes myself as a full-stack
web developer. Created a simple page that would scroll down with different sections that scrolled underneath my navbar using css position:fixed. As you can see I like the color green! Especially in monochrome!  Wanted all of my link and navbar buttons turning different color as well.
